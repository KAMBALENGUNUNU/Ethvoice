# EthVoice: Decentralized Market Access and Advocacy for Informal Workers in Africa

## ðŸ›  Introduction
EthVoice is a decentralized platform designed to empower informal workers in Africa, particularly in regions like the DRC, by addressing exploitation, financial exclusion, and trust deficits through Ethereum-based solutions. 

This project leverages **blockchain technology** to:
- Provide **direct market access** for vendors, eliminating exploitative middlemen.
- Offer **secure financial services** such as decentralized savings and microloans.
- Incentivize **digital marketing education** with tokenized rewards.
- Enable **community advocacy** through tokenized voting.

EthVoice is not just a productâ€”itâ€™s a movement to unlock the economic potential of Africaâ€™s informal sector.
