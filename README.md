## üåç Context: The Challenges in Eastern Congo
Eastern Congo is a land of immense potential but struggles with:
1. **Exploitation:** Middlemen set unfair prices, preventing workers from earning fair wages.
2. **Financial Exclusion:** Over 80% of the population lacks access to formal banking.
3. **Trust Deficit:** Corruption and instability have eroded trust in institutions.
4. **Digital Divide:** Local entrepreneurs lack access to modern tools for business growth.

üìå Example:  
A banana vendor in Goma loses nearly **50% of her earnings** to middlemen and unreliable savings systems. She markets her goods using **WhatsApp profile photos** instead of proper e-commerce tools.

This highlights the urgent need for **trustworthy, accessible, and decentralized solutions.**
